# chambers, a NYC subway crate
`chambers` is a Rust ðŸ¦€ library meant to monitor NYC subway station arrivals. It can be used to light up an LED board, where the LEDs light up/pulse when a train is arriving. We use the name "chambers", as the Chambers St. station is by far the most Rust-y station in the system!

### Development
```bash
cargo fmt --all --
cargo clippy -- -D warnings --allow dead_code
